== Zip File Content Comparator
An utility for comparing content of ZIP files.
It does not extract the files anywhere, its's using instead ZIP::ZipFile class
from RubyGem: rubyzip which enables to access ZIP files like a file system.
It uses MD5 to compare files.

It was written to compare JAR files to determine if it is necessary to
deploy (upload) them to a Java Webstart directory. Specific files, which changed
every build, contained in JAR files where ignored, which allowed to spot JAR files
which are the same for the end user and chose not to deploy them. This saved the
end user some downloading and reduced the server load.

For more info see documentation for #compare and #identical? methods.

=== Example:
  # using the #compare method:
  identical_files, different_files = ZipContentComparator.compare('old_build/myapp.jar','new_build/myapp.jar')
  list_of_changed_class_files = different_files.detect{ |file| file =~ /.class$/ } || []
  # using the #identical? method:
  ZipContentComparator.identical?('old_build/myapp.jar','new_build/myapp.jar', :detect_pattern => /.class$/)

See the source code if you want to use other methods of this class.
